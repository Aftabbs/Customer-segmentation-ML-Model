Customer Segmentation using K Means Clustering

Introduction
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant
 to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, spending habits, and more. This can be useful for companies to better understand their target audience and create more personalized marketing campaigns. In this project, I will be using K Means Clustering to segment a customer dataset.

Methodology
K Means Clustering is a machine learning algorithm that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity.
 In this project, I will use K Means Clustering to group customers into different segments based on their spending habits.

Implementation
This project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and Python. The required packages and libraries used are:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Sklearn

Results

The results of the K Means Clustering algorithm are visualized using a scatter plot. T
he plot shows the customers grouped into different segments based on their spending habits. The number of clusters can be adjusted based on the requirements of the business.

Conclusion
K Means Clustering is a simple and effective method for customer segmentation. By dividing customers into different groups, 
companies can better understand their target audience and create more personalized marketing campaigns. This project demonstrates the implementation of K Means Clustering on a customer dataset using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
